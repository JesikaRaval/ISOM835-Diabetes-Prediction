## 📌 Project Summary

This project applies predictive analytics techniques to classify patients at risk of developing Type 2 Diabetes using the Pima Indians Diabetes dataset. The primary goal is to build accurate and interpretable models to support early detection and decision-making in healthcare settings.

---

## 🎯 Project Objectives

- Predict the likelihood of diabetes in patients using medical features.
- Identify key health indicators influencing diabetes risk.
- Compare different machine learning models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest).
- Provide interpretable insights for stakeholders like doctors and public health officials.
- Address class imbalance, missing data, and ethical model implications.
